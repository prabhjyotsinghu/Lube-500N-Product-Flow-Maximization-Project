# Lube-500N-Product-Flow-Maximization-Project

In this project, have used Regression models to predict Lube 500N flow (which is one of the most high rated product in Petroleum Refinery) by adjusting the parameters/conditions on which it actually depends.

Input features have taken are those on which Lube 500N Product Production depends and Lube 500N Flow (in MT/D) is the target/output variable.

By increasing Flow, refinery can get a lot of profit as just 1 MT/D of Lube 500N Product cost around 1 Lakh INR. 

Have a look.

Thanks !!
